# Getting to Know the Unity 3D Editor

The organisation of the main windows in your running editor might differ to that shown in Figure 1 below,  because the layout can be rearranged according to your preferences. However, you should have several key windows:

The _Toolbar_ appears at the top of the Editor. It allows you to do things like play or pause your scene, or access your Unity account. It is the only part of the Editor interface that you can’t rearrange.

The _Scene_ view is your interactive view into the world you are creating.

The _Game_ view is rendered from the Camera(s) in your game. _Note of caution_: **if you make changes in the Game view these won’t be saved!**

The _Hierarchy_ window contains a list of every GameObject in the current Scene.

The _Inspector_ displays detailed information about the currently selected GameObject, including all attached components and their properties, and allows you to modify the functionality of GameObjects in your Scene.

The _Project_ window displays all of the files related to the open project. It is the main way you can navigate and find Assets and other Project files in your application.

The _Console_ window shows errors, warnings and other messages generated by Unity (and your scripts).
