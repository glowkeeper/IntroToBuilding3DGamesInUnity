# Creating the Game

Now that you've [got used to the Unity editor](./editorOverview.md), ["created some basic 3D objects"](./creating3DObjects.md) and [added some input controls](./addingInputControls.md), it's time to turn the scene into a game.

The game you are going to create is very simple. You are going to create an arena containing four zones that your ball must enter as quickly as possible: there will be left and right zones, a zone at the front, and a raised zone at the front.

## Model the Game Arena



## Add Some Trigger Zones

To turn the zoned arena into a game, you're going to use some more of Unity's [physics engine](./supplimentary/3DPhysics.md), via _Triggers_.

## Set Up the Game Controls


## Create the User Output


## Run the Game

- The [Unity Roll-a-ball tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/setting-up-the-game?uv=2020.2&projectId=5f158f1bedbc2a0020e51f0d) is a nice introduction in how to move rigidbodies in a simple game. If you want to do that, create a 3D Core project and call it  "Rollaball" and then follow the Roll-a-Ball tutorial.
